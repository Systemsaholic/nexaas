# Nexaas — Claude Working Instructions

This file instructs Claude on how to work inside the Nexaas framework codebase. Read `docs/` for deep understanding; read this file for operational rules.

## Architecture at a Glance

**Nexaas is the framework**: the Four Pillars (CAG, RAG, TAG, Contracts) running over a palace memory substrate, with BullMQ execution, pgvector retrieval, ed25519 operator signing, and a provider-agnostic model gateway. Owned by Al via Systemsaholic. Licensed perpetually to Nexmatic and other named entities.

**Nexmatic is a separate repo** (`/opt/nexmatic/`). It's the business layer built on Nexaas — Ops Console, Client Dashboard, auth, library management. Do not mix framework code with Nexmatic code.

**Read before working:**
- `docs/architecture.md` — Nexaas framework (conceptual foundation)
- `docs/skill-authoring.md` — how to build skills
- `docs/glossary.md` — terminology reference
- `docs/STATUS.md` — current build status

## Execution Model

- **Pillar pipeline** is the execution path for every skill step: CAG → RAG → Model → TAG → engine actions
- **BullMQ** (backed by Redis, per workspace VPS) is the job execution runtime. Sandboxed processors prevent worker leaks
- **Model gateway** (`@nexaas/runtime/models`) handles ALL model invocations with tier-based selection. Claude is primary; OpenAI and self-hosted are fallbacks
- **Claude Agent SDK** (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`) runs Claude headlessly via the model gateway. NEVER spawn `claude` CLI as a subprocess for skill execution
- **Claude Code CLI** is installed on every VPS as an **ops troubleshooting tool** — operators SSH in and run `claude` for maintenance. NOT for skill execution
- **MCP servers** provide tools to AI skills via the stdio protocol. Skills declare which MCP servers they need in their manifests
- **Palace** is the memory substrate. State lives in drawers, not in skill code local variables

## Skill Authoring

Skills live in `nexaas-skills/[category]/[skill-name]/` on each workspace VPS and contain:
- `skill.yaml` — manifest: id, version, triggers, execution type, MCP servers, palace rooms, TAG routing
- `prompt.md` — model prompt with Self-Reflection Protocol (required for AI skills)

See `docs/skill-authoring.md` for the full reference including model tiers, MCP integration, and the agentic loop.

### Creating Skills

Use the factory slash commands — they enforce framework conventions:
- `/new-skill` — create a new AI or shell skill (8-phase interview)
- `/new-flow` — compose multiple skills into an automation flow
- `/new-mcp` — scaffold a new MCP server
- `/nexaasify` — convert an existing automation (YAML check, script, cron job) to a Nexaas skill

### Self-Reflection Protocol

Every AI skill prompt MUST end with:

```
## Self-Reflection Protocol
If during this task you determine the current approach is insufficient
or a better method exists, output on its own line:

SKILL_IMPROVEMENT_CANDIDATE: [one paragraph — generic capability description,
no client names, no specific data, no workspace-specific context]
```

## CLI Reference

The `nexaas` CLI provides 15 commands for workspace management:

```
nexaas init --workspace <id>           Set up Nexaas on a VPS
nexaas status                          Runtime health check
nexaas health                          Detailed 10-point health report
nexaas register-skill <skill.yaml>     Register skill with BullMQ scheduler
nexaas trigger-skill <skill.yaml>      Fire a skill manually
nexaas dry-run <skill.yaml> [--live]   Validate a skill manifest
nexaas library list|contribute|install|diff|promote|feedback
nexaas propagate check|push|accept|reject
nexaas alerts [list|test|config]       Notification management
nexaas backup [run|list|test|schedule] Database backup/restore
nexaas upgrade [--check|--migrate]     Framework updates
nexaas create-mcp <name>              Scaffold MCP server
nexaas gdpr export|delete|redact|subjects|audit
nexaas verify-wal [--full]            WAL chain integrity
nexaas config [key] [value]           Workspace configuration
```

## Palace Room Ontology

State lives in rooms. Skills declare which rooms they read (retrieval) and write (output). Top-level wings:

- `inbox.*` — incoming messages and events awaiting processing
- `events.*` — domain events for triggering and audit
- `knowledge.*` — static or slow-changing reference material
- `library.*` — skill library (skills, canonical, feedback)
- `accounting.*`, `marketing.*`, `operations.*` — domain-specific business data
- `notifications.*` — pending outbound notifications and alert history
- `ops.*` — ops-visible state (escalations, errors, audits, health)

## Palace Memory vs Claude Code Memory

**Palace memory** (nexaas_memory in Postgres, via `palace_write` MCP tool): Use for business state, operational decisions, skill findings — anything other skills, sessions, or team members need to see.

**Claude Code memory** (local `.claude/` files): Use ONLY for personal operator preferences. NOT for business state.

**When in doubt, use the palace.** Palace writes are WAL-audited. Claude Code memory is siloed and invisible to skills.

## Worker Systemd Service

The `nexaas-worker.service` runs the BullMQ worker, outbox relay, and Bull Board dashboard.

**Critical deployment lessons (from Phoenix production):**
- Use direct node invocation, NOT npm/npx wrappers — snap node through npm swallows stdout and escapes cgroup cleanup
- Use `KillMode=mixed` + `ExecStopPost=fuser -k` to prevent orphan processes holding the port
- The in-process health monitor must NOT use `execSync` to curl its own Express server (deadlock)
- BullMQ scheduler-spawned jobs may arrive with empty `data` — worker must fall back to `process.env.NEXAAS_WORKSPACE`
- Shell/AI skill executors create their own `skill_runs` records — the worker must NOT duplicate them
- On startup: reconcile orphaned `skill_runs` (status='running' with stale last_activity) and deduplicate stale BullMQ repeatables

## Deploying to a New Workspace

When deploying Nexaas to a workspace for the first time:

1. Run `nexaas init --workspace <id>` — installs prerequisites, creates DB, applies migrations, generates .env, installs systemd service
2. Archive or remove ALL legacy automation artifacts — Trigger.dev code, old framework directories, `claude --print` scripts, legacy Python automations
3. Update the workspace CLAUDE.md — replace any Trigger.dev/legacy sections with Nexaas-only instructions. Add the palace vs Claude Code memory guidance blockquote
4. Seed the palace: `nexaas seed-palace <workspace-root>`
5. Create skills via `/new-skill` or convert existing automations via `/nexaasify`
6. Register skills: `nexaas register-skill <path>`
7. Set up automated backups: `nexaas backup schedule`
8. Verify: `nexaas status`, `nexaas health`

**Legacy cleanup checklist** (prevents Claude Code from reverting to old patterns):
- [ ] Archive `trigger-dev/` directories to `~/.archive-legacy-<date>/`
- [ ] Disable and archive Trigger.dev systemd services
- [ ] Remove Docker images and volumes for Trigger.dev
- [ ] Archive old `framework/` and `nexaas-framework/` directories
- [ ] Archive legacy Python scripts from workspace root
- [ ] Remove migration docs that reference old systems as "source"
- [ ] Remove old planning docs that reference Trigger.dev as core tech
- [ ] Verify CLAUDE.md contains ZERO references to Trigger.dev as an active system

## Environment Variables

Set in `.env` (never committed):

**Required:**
- `NEXAAS_WORKSPACE` — workspace ID
- `NEXAAS_ROOT` — path to nexaas installation (default: /opt/nexaas)
- `NEXAAS_WORKSPACE_ROOT` — path to workspace files
- `DATABASE_URL` — Postgres connection string
- `REDIS_URL` — Redis connection string (default: redis://localhost:6379)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — for AI skills

**Optional:**
- `VOYAGE_API_KEY` — for RAG embeddings
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` + `TELEGRAM_ALERT_CHAT_ID` — for Telegram notifications
- `RESEND_API_KEY` + `OPS_ALERT_EMAIL` — for email notifications
- `NEXAAS_WORKER_CONCURRENCY` — parallel job limit (default: 5)
- `NEXAAS_WORKER_PORT` — health/dashboard port (default: 9090)
- `NEXAAS_BACKUP_DIR` — backup storage path (default: /var/backups/nexaas)

## What NOT to Do

- Do NOT write Python. This is a TypeScript codebase.
- Do NOT use SQLite. Postgres only.
- Do NOT build custom job queues. BullMQ is the execution runtime.
- Do NOT spawn `claude` CLI as a subprocess for skill execution. Use `execution.type: ai-skill` in the manifest.
- Do NOT use Trigger.dev. It has been fully replaced by BullMQ.
- Do NOT use Qdrant. Use pgvector + Voyage-3 for vector retrieval.
- Do NOT hardcode model names. Use `model_tier: cheap|good|better|best`.
- Do NOT put client data in skill definitions.
- Do NOT commit `.env` or API keys.
- Do NOT store business state in Claude Code's local memory. Use the palace.
- Do NOT create automations outside the factory (`/new-skill`, `/new-flow`, `/nexaasify`).
